Ebcdic Ascii Tls decrypter MITM packet capture and decoder is designed to help in Pen Testing. There are not many tools out there that will capture an EBCDIC session and this is a tool that I could not find.  It will also do ASCII packet capture and with some tweaking TLS/SSL.
Code tightened up and security checked by AI.
